# Cryptonite

Cryptocurrency can be traded in the market like regular stocks. Their prices fluctuate through out the day which makes it difficult to keep track of their prices. We proposed this to help our customers to make good profits by keeping a proper record of their Crypto purchases. Our aim was to create an android application to view and track real time prices of cryptocurrencies and enable people to take knowledge from experts from experts who have a proper study and information about the market.

In this android application we have called an API i.e. CoinMarket API to fetch data on cryptocurrencies. We used the “Volley” Library to do this. The data is returned in JSON format after which we extracted relevant information and displayed it on the screen.
